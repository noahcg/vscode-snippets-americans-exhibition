# AmEx Snippets (Americans Exhibition Snippets)

## Description

These snippets were built to help MEDM with some rapid prototyping of exhibition panels.

This repo was built particularly for USHMM online exhibition use. The idea scenario would be putting a prototype together quickly. Instead of looking up an online exhibition, and grabbing the markup using devtools, now there are simple keyboard shortcuts.
